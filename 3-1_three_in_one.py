# 3.1 Three in One: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

'''
Approach 1: Fixed division: n/3 for each stack, or based on expected stack size
Approach 2: Flexibile divisions: Allow stacks to be flexibile in size:
    - when one stack exceeds capacity, grow capacity and shift elements
    - circular, such that final stack may start at end of the array and wrap around to beginning
