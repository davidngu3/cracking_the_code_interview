# Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
# cannot use additional data structures?

# IDEAS:
# If able to use additional data structures, I would use a hash table because it would allow fast lookup

def isUnique(string): 
    




# If not able to use additional data structures, I would first sort the string then check adjacent values for inequality
